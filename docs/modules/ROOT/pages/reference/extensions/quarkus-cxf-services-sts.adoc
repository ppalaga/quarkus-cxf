[id="quarkus-cxf-services-sts-usage"]
== Usage

Here are the key parts of a basic WS-Trust scenario:

* *WS-SecurityPolicy* - except for defining security requirements, such as transport protocols, encryption standards and authentication mechanisms,
  it can also set the address of Security Token Service from which clients and services have to obtain their tokens.
* *Security Token Service (STS)* - issues, validates, and renews security tokens upon request.
  It acts as a trusted authority that authenticates clients and issues tokens that assert the client's identity and permissions.
* *Client* - requests a token from the STS to access a web service.
  It must authenticate itself to the STS and provide details about the kind of token required.
* *Service* - relies on the STS to authenticate clients and validate their tokens.

=== Runnable example

There is an https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-cxf/tree/main/integration-tests/ws-trust[integration test]
covering WS-Trust in the {quarkus-cxf-project-name} source tree.
Let's walk through it and see how the individual parts are set to work together.
