= SSL

This chapter documents various use cases related to SSL, TLS and HTTPS.

NOTE: The sample code snippets used in this section come from the
     https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-cxf/tree/main/integration-tests/ws-security-policy[WS-SecurityPolicy integration test]
     in the source tree of {quarkus-cxf-project-name}


== Client SSL configuration

If your client is going to communicate with a server whose SSL certificate is not trusted by the client's operating system,
then you need to set up a custom trust store for your client.
Tools like `openssl` or Java `keytool` are commonly used for doing that.
You may want to check
https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-cxf/blob/main/integration-tests/ws-security-policy/pom.xml#L127-L440[some]
https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-cxf/blob/main/integration-tests/ws-security-policy/generate-certs.sh[examples]
in {quarkus-cxf-project-name} source tree.

Once you have prepared the trust store, you need to configure your client to use it.

=== Set the client trust store in `application.properties`

This is the easiest way to set the client trust store.
The key role is played by the following properties:

* `xref:reference/extensions/quarkus-cxf.adoc#quarkus-cxf_quarkus-cxf-client-clients-trust-store[quarkus.cxf.client."clients".trust-store]`
* `xref:reference/extensions/quarkus-cxf.adoc#quarkus-cxf_quarkus-cxf-client-clients-trust-store-type[quarkus.cxf.client."clients".trust-store-type]`
* `xref:reference/extensions/quarkus-cxf.adoc#quarkus-cxf_quarkus-cxf-client-clients-trust-store-password[quarkus.cxf.client."clients".trust-store-password]`

Here is an example:

.application.properties
[source,properties]
----
keystore.type = jks <1>
include::example$ws-security-policy/application.properties[tag=client-trust-store]
----

<1> `pkcs12` trust store type is a common alternative to `jks`.
<2> The referenced `client-truststore.jks` file has to be available in `src/main/resources` directory.

== Server SSL configuration

The server SSL configuration is driven by Quarkus HTTP layer a.k.a. Vert.x.
https://quarkus.io/guides/http-reference#ssl[Quarkus HTTP guide] provides the information about the configuration options.

Here is a basic example:

.application.properties
[source,properties]
----
include::example$ws-security-policy/application.properties[tag=server-key-store]
----

<1> The referenced `localhost.jks` file has to be available in `src/main/resources` directory.

== Enforce SSL through WS-SecurityPolicy

The requirement for the clients to connect through HTTPS can be defined in a policy.

The functionality is provided by `xref:reference/extensions/quarkus-cxf-rt-ws-security.adoc[quarkus-cxf-rt-ws-security]` extension.

Here is an example of a policy file:

.https-policy.xml
[source,properties]
----
include::example$ws-security-policy/https-policy.xml[]
----

The policy has to be referenced from a service endpoint interface (SEI):

.HttpsPolicyHelloService.java
[source,java]
----
include::example$ws-security-policy/HttpsPolicyHelloService.java[]
----

With this setup in place, any request delivered over HTTP will be rejected by the `PolicyVerificationInInterceptor`:

[source,shell]
----
ERROR [org.apa.cxf.ws.pol.PolicyVerificationInInterceptor] Inbound policy verification failed: These policy alternatives can not be satisfied:
 {http://docs.oasis-open.org/ws-sx/ws-securitypolicy/200702}TransportBinding: TLS is not enabled
 ...
