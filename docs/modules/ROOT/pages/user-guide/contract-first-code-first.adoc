= Contract first and code first approaches

include::../includes/attributes.adoc[]

Both contract first and code first development modes are fully supported by {quarkus-cxf-project-name}.

You can refer to the following CXF resources for more details on the different styles of developing a service consumer or provider:

* Developing a service consumer (or client)
** https://cxf.apache.org/docs/developing-a-consumer.html[Consumer from WSDL]
* Developing a service using JAX-WS
** https://cxf.apache.org/docs/developing-a-service.html#DevelopingaService-WSDLFirstDevelopment[Contract first development]
** https://cxf.apache.org/docs/developing-a-service.html#DevelopingaService-JavaFirstDevelopment[Code first development]

CXF provides a https://cxf.apache.org/docs/wsdl-to-java.html[wsdl2java] utility
as well as a Maven plugin called https://cxf.apache.org/docs/maven-cxf-codegen-plugin-wsdl-to-java.html[cxf-codegen-plugin]
to generate fully annotated Java code from a WSDL document.
The autogenerated Java classes are fully compatible with {quarkus-cxf-project-name}.
