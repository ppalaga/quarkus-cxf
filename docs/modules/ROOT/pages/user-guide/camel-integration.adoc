https://camel.apache.org/camel-quarkus/latest/index.html[Camel Quarkus] supports CXF since its version 2.12.0.
Under the hood, the implementation is based on {quarkus-cxf-project-name}.
Therefore, all functionality available in {quarkus-cxf-project-name} is also available in Camel Quarkus.

Please refer to https://camel.apache.org/camel-quarkus/latest/reference/extensions/cxf-soap.html[Camel Quarkus CXF SOAP] extension documentation for further details.
