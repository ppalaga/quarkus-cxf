= {quarkus-cxf-project-name} 3.21.1 release notes

== Important dependency upgrades

* Quarkus 3.21.0 -> 3.21.1 - https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-3-21-1-released/[release notes]

== Fixed issues

=== Incompatibility with Quarkus 3.21.1

The `getName()` method was added to the `io.quarkus.tls.TlsConfiguration` interface that {quarkus-cxf-project-name} also implements,
thus causing an incompatibility.
Since {quarkus-cxf-project-name} 3.21.1, {quarkus-cxf-project-name} implements that method too.
